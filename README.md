This website provides next-day stock price predictions for Nasdaq-listed stocks based on historical financial data. I am currently upgrading the platform to expand market coverage and increase the prediction frequency. The application is built using Spring Boot, Java, jQuery, Hibernate, MySQL, Thymeleaf, DataTables, and Bootstrap for presentation and functionality. Stock price predictions are powered by deep learning models, leveraging the capabilities of neural networks in financial forecasting. Neural networks have gained significant attention in finance due to their ability to analyze complex, nonlinear relationships in financial time series data without requiring predefined mathematical models. This report introduces a Keras-based LSTM model, where a four-layer neural network is trained on financial data. Additionally, another LSTM model is used for comparison to evaluate stock price prediction performance.
